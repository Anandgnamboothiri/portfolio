                <h3>Hand Gesture Recognition</h3>
                <p>AI-powered system for gesture-based interaction.   Created a PPT controlling system by hand gestures, used opencv, mediapipe, pyautogui, random forest classification algorithm etc. By using this system people can easily control PPTâ€™s just by hand gestures.</p>
